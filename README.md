Roll20 API scripts for Swords and Wizardry

**7/9/2018**
>  - Posting alpha script
>  - If you're looking at this script and you're not me, I'M SORRY!! It's ugly as hell

**TODO:**
>  - Find a way to make token-action abilities to appear without having to refresh them in the ability list
>  - transfer some variables to npc_variable to avoid character sheet auto calc removing them
>  - Used d20swsrd.com to create initial results-- used 4 spaces to distinguish statblocks from flavor text, set up alternate method
>    i.e. Search('HD:') or something similar
>  - Create menu macro --same problem as abilities.
>  - Use c.s. css to format attack abilities.
  
>  - CLEAN UP attack section.. attempt to seperate pulling the stats and breaking down attacks, hd, etc into own function
>  - pulling combat related notes from bio-- or put link to bio (already in as attribute) in attack macro.
